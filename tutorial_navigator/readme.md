This is a zoomable circle pack. It's been modified from the original https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607535 that Mike built because I didn't want to change the `radius` of the circles (I can't now remember why!). 

All of the circles are added with an equal weighting as this is just used as a non-weighted container.
